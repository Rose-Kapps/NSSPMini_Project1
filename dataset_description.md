The dataset that you will use is a snippet issued from the Human Connectome Project. In particular, this task was adapted from a previously developed one by Buckner and colleagues (Buckner et al. 2011 [2]). Participants are shown visual cues asking them to either tap their left or right fingers, or squeeze their left or right toes, or move their tongue, the goal being to map motor areas. Each block of a movement type lasted ~12 seconds (10 movements), and is preceded by a ~3 second cue. In each of the two runs, there are 13 blocks, with 2 of tongue movements, 4 of hand movements (2 right and 2 left), and 4 of foot movements (2 right and 2 left). In addition, there are 3 15-second fixation blocks per run.
